# Programming With Style

Readability is very important to programmers, since in practice programs are read and modified far more often then they are written.

Weâ€™ll have more to say about style as our programs become more complex, but a few pointers will be helpful already:

    use 4 spaces for indentation

    imports should go at the top of the file

    separate function definitions with two blank lines

    keep function definitions together

    keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the bottom of the program
