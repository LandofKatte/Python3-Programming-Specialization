Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

Yes; "save... to a list"

Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts. Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts.

Yes; "to sum up"
