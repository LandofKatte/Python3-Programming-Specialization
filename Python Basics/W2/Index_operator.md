# Index Operator: Working with the Characters of a String

The indexing operator (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index) selects a single character from a string. The characters are accessed by their position or index value. For example, in the string shown below, the 14 characters are indexed left to right from postion 0 to position 13.

It is also the case that the positions are named from right to left using negative numbers where -1 is the rightmost index and so on. Note that the character at index 6 (or -8) is the blank character.
