# Sequences & Methods

Index starts at 0.
Index[0]

## Idex() 
Only takes strings when index is used on strings, and any type when it is used on lists. For both strings and lists, index returns the leftmost index where the argument is found. If it is unable to find the argument in the string or list, then an error will occur.

## Len()
The len function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.
The function len returns the length of a list (the number of items in the list).

## Slice()
The slice operator [n:m] returns the part of the string starting with the character at index n and go up to but not including the character at index m. (Starts at 0).
Python is a zero-index based language and slices are inclusive of the first index and exclusive of the second.
A slice returns a list no matter how large the slice.

## Count()
The method then returns the number of times that the argument occured in the string/list the method was used on.
When you use count on a string, the argument can only be a string. You can’t count how many times the integer 2 appears in a string, though you can count how many times the string “2” appears in a string. For lists, the argument is not restricted to just strings.

## Split()
The .split() method returns a list.
The split method breaks a string into a list of words.
