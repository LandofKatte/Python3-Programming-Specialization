#Write code that asks the user to enter a numeric score (0-100). In response, it should print out the score and corresponding letter grade, according to the table below.
Score-----Grade
>= 90-----A
[80-90)---B
[70-80)---C
[60-70)---D
< 60------F
#The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4; however, if the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year. Write code that asks the user to input a year and output True if itâ€™s a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements.

Year
Leap?

1944
True

2011
False

1986
False

1800
False

1900
False

2000
True

2056
True
